Calendar Project

Class files:

MonthViewFrame
WeekViewFrame (encompasses current week, next week, specific week)
DayViewFrame (contains a custom-made JPanel that lists the day’s reminders, with to-the-minute degree of detail. User can cancel/modify an event from here)

NewReminderFrame (allows user to create a new reminder. Has options for every day, every day at a specific time, every week on <day of the week>, or a specific hour on a specific day. Would like to have option to remind user of the event X days/hours prior to the event)

ManageRemindersFrame (allows user to see and modify existing reminders)

DayWidget (appears in grid within MonthViewFrame and WeekViewFrame. Contains a day’s events/reminders at a glance. Double clicking opens a DayViewFrame for that day)

Reminder (description, date required. Time, location, others optional)
BackgroundWorker (handles checking if an event is due once every 60 seconds. Occurs on separate thread and spawns a notification in the system tray when one is due. Clicking on the notification bubble opens window where user can dismiss the reminder)

ReminderIO (handles opening and saving the user’s list of reminders from a file. User should be able to specify file location? (would allow saving to iCloud/OneDrive/other service for cross-device, cross-platform app usage))

Medical utilizes doctor and prescription tab contains methods and builds/saves doctor prescription information
Doctor class to contain basic get/set and to make it constructor for doctors
Prescription class to contain basic get/set and to make it constructor for prescription


Additional behavior for tray menu: (these are not separate classes)
•	Popup notification appears when a reminder has “expired” (important!)
•	Opening the notification could open the “ManageRemindersFrame”, allowing the user to dismiss the reminder. If the user decides not to, the tray icon should continue showing a “!” because they haven’t dismissed an overdue reminder (they might still need to exercise, take a pill, etc. for that day)
