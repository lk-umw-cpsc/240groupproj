Suggestion:
I would recommend downloading github for desktop as it will help you tremendously.
https://desktop.github.com/

Once logged in you can pull a repository easily and select the location you want it to go to. 
You can then update and then push into the repository easily.

Instructions: 
Once github desktop or your Version control is installed log in.

You should have an that Joon Yi has shared the repository control with you to you. Accept if you have a notification. 
If you have not given me access to your github email please let me know.

At the top left of github desktop is a drop down menu called
"Current Respository"
If CPSC-240-Final-Group-Project is not selected, select the drop down and then select it. If you do not see it, please let me know. You may not have access yet.
When you select it, to the right of current repository current branch, and to the right of that is fetch origin.
Current Branch allows you to make a copy of the working project so users updating or manipulating and pushing their code will not damage yours if theirs is broken.
Make your own branch and name it with your name.
When editing edit from your branch.
If it works then you can migrate your data over to the  main branch.
Simply select current branch, than a popup window should come up saying.
Leave my changes or bring my changes.
Bring your changes.

To update our repository:

Select Fetch Origin.
You must pull first so we stay on the same updates.

On the bottom  left hand side add a small summary.
Add a description if your summary isn't enough, then click "Commit to main"
The "fetch origin" button will change to "push origin"
If it does not change, "fetch origin" again or make sure you "committed to main"
Then  "push to origin"

Note: You can update the branch to the main but it takes a little more time. 
Save changes while in your branch, then fetch, then push then you should be able to create a pull request.
This will open a browser window.
This is to update why you're pulling, you can leave this blank.
After the computer verifies that your branch does not have any conflicts with the "main branch" you can merge your pull request, adding the additional things to  the main branch. 
If there are conflicts you must click  resolve conflicts.
It will show you what's editing.
If you can not make a safe call on if the conflicts can be resolved, send an email or message to the group and wait for a response.
To resolve, delete the >>>> and >>>> which have the names of the branches and you should be able to mark it as resolved.


Make sure to try to update the UpdateLog.md document as well so we can keep a quick log of changes.

If you have any issues email me(Joon).
